# Generating Developer Tokens

Generate a developer token needed to make requests to Apple Music API.

## Discussion

To make requests to the Apple Music API, you need to authorize yourself as a trusted developer and member of the Apple Developer Program. The header of every Apple Music API request requires a signed developer token.

There are two paths to generate developer tokens:

- If you’re developing an app for Apple platforms (iOS, tvOS, watchOS or macOS), the recommended way to integrate with Apple Music is to use [`MusicKit`](../musickit.md) for Swift, following the steps provided in [`Using-Automatic-Token-Generation-for-Apple-Music-API`](../musickit/using-automatic-token-generation-for-apple-music-api.md).
- Follow the directions below to create and manage developer tokens for other platforms.

### Create a Developer Token

A developer token is a signed token used to authenticate a developer in Apple Music requests. [Creating a MusicKit identifier and private key](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/create-a-media-identifier-and-private-key/) allows you to use a developer token to authenticate yourself as a trusted developer and member of the Apple Developer Program.

The Apple Music API supports the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification, so you can pass statements and metadata called *claims*. For more information, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) and the available libraries for generating signed JWTs.

Construct a developer token as a JSON object whose header contains:

- The algorithm (`alg`) you use to sign the token, which should have a value of `ES256`
- A 10-character key identifier (`kid`) key, obtained from your developer account

> Important:
> Apple Music supports only developer tokens signed with the ES256 algorithm. Apple Music rejects unsecured developer tokens or developer tokens signed with other algorithms. These rejections result in a `401` error code.

In the *claims* payload of the token, include:

- The *issuer* (`iss`) registered claim key, whose value is your 10-character Team ID, obtained from your developer account
- The *issued at* (`iat`) registered claim key, whose value indicates the time at which the token was generated, in terms of the number of seconds since epoch, in UTC
- The *expiration time* (`exp`) registered claim key, whose value must not be greater than `15777000` (6 months in seconds) from the current Unix time on the server
- Optional, but recommended for web clients, use the *origin claim* (`origin`). Only use this JWT if the origin header of the request matches one of the values in the array. This addition helps prevent unauthorized use of the tokens. For example: “`origin`”`:[`”`https://example.com`”`,`”`https://music.example.com`”`]`.

> Tip:
> To locate your Team ID, sign in to your [developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account), and click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership Information section under the team name.

A decoded developer token has the following format.

```other
{
     "alg": "ES256",
     "kid": "ABC123DEFG"
}
{
     "iss": "DEF123GHIJ",
     "iat": 1437179036,
     "exp": 1493298100
}
```

After you create the token, sign it with your MusicKit private key using the ES256 algorithm.

> Note:
> ES256 is the [JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518) name for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash.

### Authorize Requests

A developer token is used to authorize all Apple Music API requests. If you manage this directly, in all requests, pass the `Authorization: Bearer` header set to the developer token.

```other
curl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer [developer token]' "https://api.music.apple.com/v1/test"
```

To sign in and authenticate requests for an Apple Music subscriber, see [User Authentication for MusicKit](../applemusicapi/user-authentication-for-musickit.md). For more information about requests, responses, and error handling, see [Handling Requests and Responses](../applemusicapi/handling-requests-and-responses.md).

### Request Rate Limiting

Apple Music API limits the number of requests your app can make using a developer token within a specific period of time. If this limit is exceeded, you’ll temporarily receive `429 Too Many Requests` error responses for requests that use the token. This error resolves itself shortly after the request rate has reduced.
